Twitter Sentiment Analysis Pipeline for E-Health Data
his repository contains the code and resources for an end-to-end Twitter sentiment analysis pipeline designed to uncover insights, trends, and public sentiment related to E-Health using Twitter data.

Overview
This project focuses on conducting sentiment analysis on Twitter data related to E-Health using specific hashtags. By leveraging this pipeline, you can extract tweets from Twitter's API, preprocess the data, visualize key insights, classify or tag tweets using textblob and Vader classifiers, and even perform N-grams analysis.

Pipeline Components
The pipeline includes the following key components:

Tweet Extraction: We extract tweets from Twitter's API using specified hashtags. The code for this data scraping process is provided in this repository.

Data Preprocessing: The extracted data undergoes preprocessing, which includes text cleaning, tokenization, and removing stopwords. This step ensures the data is ready for analysis.

Data Visualization: We use data visualization techniques to create informative plots and charts that provide insights into the sentiment and trends in the E-Health data.

Classification/Tagging: Tweets are classified or tagged using two popular sentiment analysis classifiers: textblob and Vader. This step helps categorize tweets as positive, negative, or neutral.

Machine Learning: You have the option to train machine learning algorithms on the labeled data to improve sentiment classification. Feel free to explore different ML models to enhance accuracy.

N-grams Analysis: Analyze the data using N-grams, which can reveal important phrases and combinations of words that contribute to the sentiment of the tweets.

Dataset Generation
The dataset used in this project was generated by scraping tweets biweekly from Twitter. The code for data scraping is provided in this repository, allowing you to reproduce the dataset or customize it to your needs.
