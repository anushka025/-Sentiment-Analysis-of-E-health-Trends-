# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Pipeline for E-Health Data

This repository provides a comprehensive solution for analyzing public sentiment and uncovering trends related to E-Health using Twitter data. By leveraging this pipeline, you can extract tweets, preprocess them for analysis, classify sentiments, and visualize insights to better understand discussions around E-Health.

---

## **Overview**
The project is centered on conducting sentiment analysis of tweets related to E-Health topics and hashtags. It enables users to:
- Extract tweets using Twitter's API.
- Preprocess data to ensure analysis-readiness.
- Visualize key insights and trends.
- Classify tweets with sentiment analysis tools such as TextBlob and VADER.
- Train machine learning models to improve classification accuracy.
- Explore important phrases through N-grams analysis.

## **Pipeline Components**
The sentiment analysis pipeline comprises the following stages:

### 1. **Tweet Extraction**
Tweets are extracted from Twitter's API based on specific E-Health-related hashtags. The repository includes code to automate this data scraping process.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**
Extracted tweets are prepared for analysis by:
- Cleaning text to remove noise (e.g., URLs, special characters, and extra spaces).
- Tokenizing text.
- Removing stopwords to enhance meaningful analysis.

### 3. **Data Visualization**
Interactive and informative visualizations are created to present insights on:
- Sentiment distribution (positive, negative, neutral).
- Trends over time.
- Frequently used words and hashtags.

### 4. **Classification/Tagging**
Tweets are tagged using two popular sentiment analysis tools:
- **TextBlob**
- **VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)**  
These tools classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

### 5. **Machine Learning**
For enhanced accuracy, machine learning models are trained using the labeled data. Algorithms explored include:
- Na√Øve Bayes
- Decision Trees
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

### 6. **N-grams Analysis**
N-grams (bigrams, trigrams, etc.) are analyzed to identify common phrases and word combinations that contribute to the sentiment of tweets.

## **Dataset**
The dataset was generated by scraping tweets biweekly from Twitter. This repository provides the code to reproduce or customize the dataset according to your requirements.

---

## **Key Findings**
- Tweets about E-Health in India show a predominantly positive sentiment, with negative sentiment being the least frequent.
- VADER provided the most accurate results due to its extensive dictionary tailored for social media language, particularly Twitter.
- Machine learning algorithms further enhanced the accuracy of sentiment classification.
